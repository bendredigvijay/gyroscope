### **GyroScope Indicator - ### Author  **Digvijay Bendre**


This **Gyro Heading Indicator** is a **digital compass** that simulates the movement of a ship’s or aircraft’s heading. It consists of:  

1. **Rotating Dial (Compass Scale)**  
   - The outer scale rotates based on the **current heading**.  
   - **Degree markers (0° to 360°)** indicate the direction.  

2. **Fixed Arrow (Red Marker)**  
   - Always points to **0° (North)** as a reference.  
   - The rotating scale moves around it, showing the current heading.  

3. **Current Heading Display**  
   - Shows the **numerical heading** in degrees at the center.  
   - The heading gradually **animates smoothly** to the new value.  

4. **Rate of Turn (ROT)**  
   - Displays how fast the heading is changing (degrees per minute).  
   - Indicates if the vessel is turning **left or right**.  

### **Working Principle**  
- The dial rotates in the **opposite direction** of the heading change.  
- If the ship turns **right (clockwise)**, the dial rotates **left (counterclockwise)**.  
- The movement is **smoothly animated** to replicate real-world gyro behavior.  

This component provides a **realistic and responsive** simulation of a **Gyro Compass**, commonly used in **maritime and aviation navigation.** 🚢✈️
